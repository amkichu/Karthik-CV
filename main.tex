\subsection{Masters}
\cvitem{\emph {Thesis Title}}{Text Independent Automatic Speaker Recognition in Malayalam
%\newline{}The problem statement is to recognize persons from their voice with no constraints on the words that they are allowed to use by overcoming the physical differences and the characteristic manner of speaking among them. Different speech processing techniques like pre-emphasis, frame blocking and windowing have been used to process the speech utterances in the Malayalam language. MFCC and its derivatives have been used to extract the speaker-specific features. The speaker model is trained using Gaussian Mixture Models and stored into the database. The focus of this work is in applications which require high identification rates using short utterance from unconstrained speech.

%\newline{}A Matlab-Simulink simulation of the $IEEE 802.11b$ with changes made only to the Physical layer, that resulting in higher data rates and more robust connectivity. Barker coding is the modulation technique for lower data rates ($1, 2 Mbps$) and Complementary Code Keying for higher data rates ($5.5$ and $11 Mbps)$ and all data rates are using Direct Sequence Spread Spectrum transmission to reduce jamming and eavesdropping. The tradeoff is either you increase power or decrease range to maintain signal quality. As you move away from the radio, the radio adapts and uses a less complex and slower encoding mechanism to send data, resulting in the lower data rates. The results are expressed in $BER$ to $E_b/N_0$ dependency.
}
%\cvitem{}{Tools - Matlab \& Simulink, Communication Toolbox, OS - Windows 7, Duration - 1 month}

\cvitem{}{Alias Minimization of 1-D Signals using DCT based Learning
%\newline{}It is possible to transmit an analog signal by undersampling it and recover the same with minimum distortion at the receiver by this approach, resulting in reduced data storage. Given an under-sampled test speech signal and a training set consisting of several speech signals each of which is under-sampled as well as sampled at greater than Nyquist rate, the non-aliased frequencies for the test signal using the training set are estimated. The comparison with standard interpolation techniques indicates better performance in terms of both subjective and quantitative analysis.

%\cvitem{}{Cognitive Radio Technology for Smart Home Applications
%\newline{} With an increase in the communication-enabled devices, there is a need for detecting underutilized frequency channels in the smart home environment for the communication among them. Using methods of non-cooperative sensing of Cognitive Radio, the spectral congestion can be eluded from the smart home environment and provide a green alternative for the existing smart home. A prototype is developed using USRP module and different methods of spectrum sensing are compared in the smart home environment.

%\cvitem{\emph {Seminar}}{Agile Spectrum Evacuation in Cognitive Radio Networks
%\newline{}Cognitive Radios have been advanced as a technology for the opportunistic use of under-utilized spectrum since they are able to sense the spectrum and use the frequency band if no primary user is detected. This method of agile spectrum evacuation allows any secondary user to continue using the band until the return of the primary user is detected through the formation of a set of users that exclusively engages in sensing primary user in a co-operative manner. Better interference protection and enhanced spectrum utilization are achieved using this approach.}

%Engineering had always fascinated me right from my school days. My educational background has instilled in me the qualities required to meet the rigor of this demanding profession. Graduation in Electronics \& Communication Engineering has provided a strong foundation in understanding the possibility of developing the technology in different areas of life and in connecting the acquired knowledge to meet the social needs. I had my electives  for Bachelors in DSP Controllers, Satellite Communication Systems and Television Engineering \& RADAR systems.\newline{}
%
%Masters in Advanced Communication \& Information Systems has not only given me a sound and firm grounding in Communication Engineering but also taught me the invaluable skills to manage, lead and collaborate effectively with people. As a result, I had publications in IEEE Conferences also. During the course, I took up projects on Cognitive Radio, Alias Minimization, CCK \& Barker coding and TDMA for Satellite applications that are described in my enclosed resume. It developed in me the ability to analyze problems, constraints and limitations of the real world and how to manage them. Throughout, my scholastic records and achievements have been outstanding. I have secured second rank during the Masters education. The subjects studied matching the job profile includes Communication Networks, Real Time \& Embedded Systems, Wireless Communication, Satellite Communication etc.\newline{}
